# COGS260-Image-Recognition

Code for UCSD CogSci 260 Image Recognition

# Project 1

* OpenCV Basic (I/O, Smoothing, Denoising, Enhancement).

* Canny, Sobel and Structure Forest Edge Detection.

* Structure Forest Ref: https://github.com/ArtanisCV/StructuredForests.

# Project 2

Project2 is finished in Python2.

* CNN, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for MNIST classification.

* Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) + SVM for MNIST classification.

* SPM Ref: https://github.com/CyrusChiu/Image-recognition.

# Project3

* Least Square Estimation vs Parabola Estimation and L1-norm vs L2-norm.
* Perceptron Learning for Iris Dataset and compare the performance with raw data and Z-Score data.
* Feed Forward Neural Network for self-defined number of layers with self-defined number of neurons on MNIST.
* Modified AlexNet with Mini-batch training, evaluating different optimizers and accelerating tricks on CIFAR-10.
